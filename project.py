# Import and initialize the pygame library
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
pygame.init()

# Import functions for drawing gridlines and using sprites
from pygame_grid import make_grid
from ucc_sprite import Sprite

### SET UP GLOBAL CONSTANTS HERE
WIDTH = 640
HEIGHT = 360
BACKGROUND_COLOR = "white"

# Create and open a pygame screen with the given size
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
grid = make_grid()

# Set the title of the pygame screen
pygame.display.set_caption("My Game")

# Create a clock to keep track of time
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Group to hold all of the active sprites
all_sprites = pygame.sprite.LayeredUpdates()

### SET UP YOUR GAME HERE



### DEFINE HELPER FUNCTIONS



# Main Loop
running = True
while running:
    # Set the frame rate to 60 frames per second
    clock.tick(60)

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Check if the quit (X) button was clicked
        if event.type == QUIT:
            running = False

        ### MANAGE OTHER EVENTS SINCE THE LAST FRAME
        


    ### MANAGE GAME STATE FRAME-BY-FRAME
    


    # Update the sprites' locations
    all_sprites.update()

    # Clear the screen
    screen.fill(BACKGROUND_COLOR)

    # Redraw the sprites
    all_sprites.draw(screen)

    # Uncomment the next line to show a grid
    # screen.blit(grid, (0,0))

    # Flip the changes to the screen to the computer display
    pygame.display.flip()
